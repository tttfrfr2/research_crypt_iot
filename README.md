# research_crypt_iot

As shown in https://github.com/tttfrfr2/research_crypt_iot/tree/main/arduino/enc/Display, we have implemented an application that performs UART cryptographic communication between the M5StickC and the communicator.
We would like to measure and compare the processing time of this process with that of ATECC608A (https://github.com/tttfrfr2/research_crypt_iot/tree/main/arduino/eccx08/aes).
